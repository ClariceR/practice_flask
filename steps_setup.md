## Project setup
# How do I start?

First install Flask:

`pip3 install flask`

Create a file where your flask routes are going to live

`touch my_flights_api.py`

Create an utils file to store your functions

`touch utils.py`

Create a client-side file to send the requests and display info

`touch client-side.py`

Now we just need a fake data file to act as the DB in this first iteration,
and then populate the file with dummy data.

`touch flights_data.py`
